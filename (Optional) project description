The project I frequently use and really interestted in is Twitter.

According to the net information, Twitter storage consists of a number of tools:

1.Hadoop
    which clusters running both compute and HDFS
2. Manhattan 
    which clusters for all our low latency key value stores
3. Graph 
    which stores sharded MySQL clusters
4. Blobstore 
    which clusters all large objects (videos, pictures, binary filesâ€¦)
5. Cache clusters
6. Messaging clusters
7. Relational stores
    (MySQL, PostgreSQL and Vertica)
    
   
  Out of all that, the biggest one is Hadoop (which is obvious, as Hadoop is an DFS for Big Gata storages). 
  The second one is also a Storage System - Manhattan - that was created by Twitter themselves.
  And the third is a MySQL database.
  All of the rest ones are either NoSQL or Graph databases, that are also popular these days.
  
  By the third link it is said that Twitter has has plans on moving to it's own datacenters, so it's probably impossible to say how much 
  exactly it has now. But it's possible to say that over 70 servers.
