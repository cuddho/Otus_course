Studies Project Description:

A Wallet project is a simplified version of a Wallet application platform. 

The general idea is to create an OLTP Relational database architecture, that 
1. has a regularly updated queue of incoming events (JSON's)
2. parses them by their key values
3. Runs dependent correct DDL/DML on vocabularies and meta tables
4. Has internal features for
    - data validation checks
    - data monitorings
5. Generates views for data statistics of a users involved
6. Makes regular backups
7. Runs alerts on misbehaviours
8. Runs required JOBs on Data features (e.g. rebuild views, generate export scv files etc.)
9. Has additional ETL features.

Main Objects of its current OOP model are:
- person
- wallet
- card
- offer issuer
- offer

Those objects can also have subobjects, such as Card_types etc.
